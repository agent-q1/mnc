                 <h2>Inter-Hall</h2>
                 <p>Galaxy is an intra-IITK event which seeks participation from the students in the form of pools. Both UG and PG students combine to put forth their creative juices to work on various events in dance, dramatics, music, literature, and so much more. Galaxy is aimed at unearthing talent from people who don’t even know that it existed within them. The competition is intense to claim the bragging rights, and each pool has a near-crazy team who works to achieve that success.</p>

                 <p>For many incoming freshers, the two years of JEE preparation is a tedious experience to say the least. After narrowing their eyes on books for a long time, the Freshers’ Night introduces themselves to the endless possibilities which the council offers. Each club has numerous events which come together to constitute a memorable night in the first month of college. It’s a great stage to showcase your talents to your batchmates. You can dance, narrate, paint, and much more. Trust us; few people remember your first quiz score. Many more remember your Freshers’ performance.</p>

                 <h2>Cinematic Experience</h2>   
                 <p>The Montage Film Fest of IIT Kanpur is not just a celebration or an event, but an experience. An experience that we hope will change your outlook on cinema. Main-stream or Bollywood is but a small part of our rich cinematic heritage and we hope that the festival would provide the campus with an opportunity to experience great cinema, both contemporary and classic, that has often gone unnoticed by many of us . The festival would not only broaden and enhance the viewing experience of the audience but also introduce them to the wonders of artistic qualities of the media .</p>

                  <p>Unlike the UG community, there is a whole lot of shrouded talent in the PG community. Impressions is the annual cultural festival for the PG community to bring out these hidden gems and give them a proper stage to showcase their talents. Be it standup comedy or monoacts, we cater it all.</p>
